# 🎯 portr8 — Iterative Character-Consistent Portrait Convergence Engine

> **For Gemini:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Build `portr8`, a CLI tool that generates photorealistic character-consistent images in an iterative feedback loop — generating, judging, and refining until both **resemblance** and **prompt adherence** scores hit ≥ 8/10 (hence the name: "portr-8").

**Architecture:** A closed-loop pipeline: Generate → Judge → Overlay scores → Decide strategy (edit vs. regenerate) → Feed back critique → Repeat. All iterations are tracked in a JSONL ledger. A final Markdown report/slide deck is auto-generated showing the convergence journey. A separate calibration mode lets Riccardo cross-rate the AI judge against multiple models.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.11+, `uv` (PEP 723 inline script deps), `google-genai` SDK, Pillow, FFmpeg, `rich`, `pydantic`, Markdown/HTML slide generation.

**Upstream dependency:** Reuses patterns and libraries from [`~/git/gemini-tools/`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/) — specifically [`generate_photo.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/generate_photo.py), [`judge_image.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/judge_image.py), and [`eval_single_model.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/eval_single_model.py).

**Direct ancestor:** [`find_golden_kate_candidate.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/find_golden_kate_candidate.py) — a linear generate→judge→stop loop with fixed prompts. portr8 generalizes this into a closed-loop system with feedback piggybacking, dual-axis scoring, and adaptive strategy.

## 🧪 Lessons Learned from gemini-tools (Empirical Findings)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These lessons are distilled from **months of empirical experimentation** documented in [`EVAL.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/EVAL.md), [`INVESTIGATION_GCS_DIRECT_REFERENCES.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/INVESTIGATION_GCS_DIRECT_REFERENCES.md), [`PROMPT_STRATEGY_EXPERIMENTS.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/PROMPT_STRATEGY_EXPERIMENTS.md), and [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). **portr8 MUST encode these as hard design constraints.**

### Lesson 1: Reference Transport Matters More Than Prompting

| Method | Typical Score | Finding |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| Inline Base64 (PIL resize) | 5.2 – 6.0 | ❌ Client-side resampling causes **AI beautification** — facial smoothing, generic model features |
| Files API (`client.files.upload`) | 6.8 – 8.2 | ✅ Preserves full-resolution micro-biometrics (cheek moles, iris color, teeth gaps) |
| GCS Direct URI (`types.Part.from_uri`) | 4.8 – 7.0 | 🟡 Zero network overhead but requires bucket setup; quality varies |

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Default to **Files API** (`--files-api`) for reference image transport. Support PIL fallback and GCS as options, but Files API is the proven winner for human-rated scores.

### Lesson 2: AI Judge Scores Correlate With Human Scores — Mostly

From the Alessandro benchmark matrix in [`EVAL.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/EVAL.md):

| Image | AI Score | Human Score | Match? |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `candidate5.png` | 3.5 | 2.0 | ✅ Exact alignment ("Che schifo") |
| `candidate2.png` | 5.2 | 5.0 | ✅ Exact alignment |
| `candidate4.png` | 7.8 | 6.5 | ⚠️ AI overrates by ~1.3 |
| `candidate7_files_api.png` | 7.8 | **8.2** | ✅ AI underrates slightly |

But from the Kate matrix — **catastrophic miscalibration found:**

| Image | AI Score | Human Score | Match? |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `kate2016_kenya_lion.png` | **7.0** | **1.0** | 🚨 **6-point gap!** "non le somiglia per niente" |
| `exp1_cand1..3` | 7.5 – 7.8 | 6.5 | ⚠️ AI overrates |
| `exp2_cand1..3` | 4.2 – 4.5 | 0.0 | 🗑️ Both agree it's trash |

**→ portr8 design constraint:** The AI judge is **necessary but not sufficient**. The calibration tool (`bin/calibrate.py`) is NOT optional — it's a first-class feature. The system must warn when AI scores are high but past calibration data suggests the judge is unreliable for this character.

### Lesson 3: Negative Prompt Constraints FAIL

From [`PROMPT_STRATEGY_EXPERIMENTS.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/PROMPT_STRATEGY_EXPERIMENTS.md):

| Strategy | Approach | Score |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| Strategy 1 | Explicit A/B/C Reference Binding + Anti-Beautification | **6.5** |
| Strategy 2 | Negative Constraints ("NO model skin", "NO altered nose") | **3.6** ❌ |
| Strategy 3 | Biometric Feature Blueprint (positive descriptions) | **6.5** 👑 |

**→ portr8 design constraint:** The strategist MUST NEVER generate negative constraint prompts ("DO NOT", "NO", "AVOID"). Instead, it must use **positive biometric blueprinting** ("authentic natural skin texture with visible pores", "warm smile with fine lines around eyes") and **explicit reference binding** ("the exact person shown in the reference photographs").

### Lesson 4: Consistency in Cartoons is TOO EASY — Non-Goal

From [`EVAL.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/EVAL.md):
> "Consistency in Cartoons is TOO EASY, so it's a non-goal. We want photo-realistic pics."

**→ portr8 design constraint:** The judge MUST include a **photorealism axis** (`is_photorealistic: bool`). If an iteration produces a cartoon/illustration, it's rated 0 on that axis and the strategist forces a full regeneration with explicit photorealism cues. The system should add "photorealistic, 85mm lens, camera-like depth of field" to ALL prompts.

### Lesson 5: The "Schifo Threshold" — Scores Below 6.0 Are Garbage

From empirical data, Riccardo's ratings follow a clear pattern:
- **≥ 8.0**: "Buono!" / CAPOLAVORO — usable in production
- **7.0 – 7.9**: "Meh" — recognizable but not convincing
- **5.0 – 6.9**: "Non le/gli somiglia" — reject
- **< 5.0**: "Fa SCHIFO" / "Che schifo" — total failure

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Use Italian-flavored verdict labels: `CAPOLAVORO` (≥8), `BUONO` (≥7), `COSÌ-COSÌ` (≥5), `SCHIFO` (<5). This matches Riccardo's natural vocabulary and makes the output immediately interpretable.

### Lesson 6: AI Beautification is the #1 Enemy

From [`INVESTIGATION_GCS_DIRECT_REFERENCES.md`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/docs/INVESTIGATION_GCS_DIRECT_REFERENCES.md):
> "Client-side base64 / PIL resizing causes AI beautification and facial smoothing (scores ~5.2 – 6.0)."

And from EVAL.md, Kate experiments:
> "Abbellimento artificiale" / "sembra troppo vecchia e brutta" / "Invecchiamento AI irrealistico"

The models tend to either **smooth/beautify** (doll face) or **age/uglify** (wrong wrinkles). Both are failures.

**→ portr8 design constraint:** The judge prompt MUST explicitly penalize beautification:
> "If the generated face has unnaturally smooth skin, symmetrical doll-like features, or shows obvious AI beautification/smoothing, REDUCE the resemblance score to ≤ 5.0."

### Lesson 7: Reference Photo Quality Determines the Ceiling

From [`evaluate_reference_photos.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/evaluate_reference_photos.py) and the LOO (Leave-One-Out) evaluation:
- Photos scoring < 6.0 against the rest of the set are classified as `PRUNE_BAD_ANGLE` and cause **model drift**
- Photos in `grid_cleaned/` (pre-cropped single-subject) outperform raw multi-person photos
- Sorting by file size (descending) prioritizes high-resolution photos

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Before the main loop starts, run a quick reference quality check. If `grid_cleaned/` directory exists for the character, prefer it. Warn the user if reference photos score poorly against each other. Consider adding a `portr8 check-refs -c riccardo` subcommand.

### Lesson 8: The Seed Parameter Enables Reproducibility

From [`eval_single_model.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/eval_single_model.py#L188):
```python
current_seed = seed if seed is not None else random.randint(1, 2147483647)
```

The seed is passed to `GenerateContentConfig(seed=current_seed)` and logged in the JSONL record.

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Every iteration MUST log its seed. Provide `--seed` for deterministic replay. When running dual strategy (edit vs. regenerate), use the same seed for fair comparison.

### Lesson 9: FFmpeg Overlay Pattern is Proven

From [`eval_single_model.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/eval_single_model.py#L82-L129):
1. Create a transparent PNG banner with Pillow (`ImageDraw.Draw`)
2. Composite with FFmpeg: `ffmpeg -y -i input.png -i banner.png -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]overlay=(W-w)/2:H-h-30"`
3. Fall back to pure Pillow if FFmpeg is unavailable

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Reuse this exact pattern. The banner should be positioned at the **bottom** of the image. Include iteration number, both scores, photorealism check, and verdict.

### Lesson 10: Provenance Metadata is Essential

From [`generate_photo.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/generate_photo.py#L206-L217): Every generated image gets a `.json` sidecar with:
- `generated_asset_path` (tilde-normalized)
- `source_reference_paths`
- `prompt`
- `model_used`
- `generation_timestamp`

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Every iteration record in the JSONL ledger must include full provenance. Use `to_tilde_path()` for human-readable paths. Also store the augmented prompt (with feedback piggybacked), not just the original.

### Lesson 11: The `find_golden_kate_candidate.py` Pattern = portr8 v0

[`find_golden_kate_candidate.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/find_golden_kate_candidate.py) is literally a simpler version of portr8:
1. Fixed list of 10 prompt variants → portr8 uses a **single prompt with adaptive augmentation**
2. Linear generate → judge → stop if ≥ 8.0 → portr8 adds **feedback piggybacking**
3. Single-axis score (biometric only) → portr8 uses **dual-axis** (resemblance + adherence)
4. No strategy selection → portr8 adds **edit vs. regenerate intelligence**
5. No report generation → portr8 adds **slide deck**

**→ portr8 design constraint:** This is the spiritual successor. Maintain the same Rich console output style (Panel, bold colors, emoji), the same threshold semantics (≥ 8.0 = GOLDEN), and the same "wake up Riccardo" celebration when convergence is reached.

### Lesson 12: `gemini-3.5-flash` is the Proven Judge Model

Across all experiments in gemini-tools, `gemini-3.5-flash` is used as the default judge. It supports structured JSON output via `response_schema=PydanticModel` and `response_mime_type="application/json"`.

Fallback chain for judging: `gemini-3.5-flash` → `gemini-3.6-flash` → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`.

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Default `--judge-model` to `gemini-3.5-flash`. The calibration tool should test this against alternatives.

### Lesson 13: Existing eval_dataset.py + Web Portal Pattern

[`eval_single_model.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/eval_single_model.py#L290-L295) upserts records into `evaluations.jsonl` via an `eval_dataset` module, and there's a web portal (`web/server.js`) for human review.

**→ portr8 design constraint:** Consider compatibility with the gemini-tools JSONL format for records that have `robot_eval` and `human_eval` fields, and a `status: "PENDING_HUMAN"` workflow. This allows reusing the web approval UI if desired.

## ✅ Resolved Design Decisions (from Riccardo's Review)

### Decision 1: Target Score — Overridable, Default 8

`--target-score N` defaults to `8.0` (matching the project name "portr-8") but is fully overridable. For quick tests use `--target-score 6.0`, for production quality use `--target-score 9.0`.

### Decision 2: Character Reference Images — Public Repo, Private Data

The portr8 repo is **public**. Character reference photos are **private** (PII — real family photos). Strategy:

- `data/characters/` exists in the repo but is in `.gitignore` — NO images committed
- `data/characters/.gitkeep` + `README.md` explains the setup
- `--ref-dir` flag (default: `data/characters/`) lets the user point to ANY directory
- For Riccardo's private testing: `--ref-dir ~/git/gic/private/projects/git-privatize/github.com__palladius__media-arneis/data/characters/`
- Each character folder MAY contain a `character.yaml` with metadata (name, age, hair color, eye color, description, `synthetic: bool`). portr8 reads this to enrich judge prompts.
- For CI/demos: ship 2-3 **synthetic test characters** (AI-generated "personas" with 5 reference photos each, `synthetic: true`) that ARE committable — but resemblance testing is skipped/soft for synthetic characters.

> [!NOTE]
> The private character vault chain: `~/git/gic/private/.../media-arneis/data/characters/` → symlinked into `~/git/gemini-tools/data/characters/` → usable via `--ref-dir`.

### Decision 3: Edit vs. Regenerate — LLM-Smart + Stupid Fallback

The strategist uses **LLM intelligence** to decide based on the judge feedback (Lesson #3 logic). But when `--dual-strategy` is active, it does BOTH (edit + regenerate), judges both, picks the winner. This is the "stupid but thorough" route.

**Critical requirement**: Every step's strategy choice, prompts used, and rationale MUST be kept **deterministically** in the JSONL ledger. Full trace, full reproducibility.

### Decision 4: Slide Deck — Markdown → HTML ✅

Zero-dependency Markdown → HTML. Self-contained (base64-embedded images).

### Decision 5: Convergence Failure — Exit Non-Zero, Still Produce Report

If `--max-iterations` is exhausted without reaching the target:
- Exit code = `1` (non-zero)
- **Still produce** the full slide deck / report, but with a **red failure banner**: "❌ FAILED — Best: R:6.5 A:7.0 (target was 8.0)"
- Highlight the best-so-far iteration with 🥈 instead of 🏆
- The trace/markdown is still **super useful** for debugging and iterating

### Decision 6: Reproducible Output Folders

All run outputs go into: `out/YYYYMMDD-HHMM-<prompt-slug>/`

Each folder is a **self-contained reproducibility capsule** containing:
- All generated images (`image_001.png`, `image_001_scored.png`, ...)
- All prompts used (original + augmented) in the JSONL ledger
- All judge verdicts as JSON sidecars
- The `character.yaml` snapshot (copy of the character metadata at run time)
- Reference image paths (tilde-normalized, not the images themselves — those are private)
- `run_config.json` — full CLI config used
- `portr8_version` — software version string (from `VERSION` file)
- `report.md` + `report.html` — the convergence report

This means tomorrow, with newer software, you can inspect exactly what happened today and compare.

## Remaining Open Questions

1. **Multi-character scenes**: Should portr8 support multiple characters in one image (e.g., "Riccardo and Kate eating gelato")? → Per-character resemblance scores needed. **Proposing: v0.1 = single character only, v0.2 = multi-character.**
2. **Rater calibration**: Separate `portr8 calibrate` subcommand vs. `--calibrate-first` flag? **Proposing: separate subcommand** — calibration is a distinct workflow.
3. **Edit model**: Same `--image-model` for both edit and regenerate? **Proposing: same model, simplest approach.** Add `--edit-model` later if needed.
4. **API key**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` from env (matching gemini-tools pattern). No `--api-key` flag — env vars are safer.

### Component 1: Core Data Models (`lib/models.py`)

#### [NEW] [`lib/models.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/models.py)

Pydantic models for structured judge output and iteration tracking.

```

---

### Component 2: Image Generator (`lib/generator.py`)

#### [NEW] [`lib/generator.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/generator.py)

Wraps `google-genai` for both **generation** (text+refs → image) and **editing** (image+refs+instructions → image). Reuses the same API patterns as [`generate_photo.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/generate_photo.py).

**Key functions:**
- `generate_from_prompt(prompt, ref_images, model, output_path, seed, transport)` → generates a new image from scratch
- `edit_image(source_image, edit_instructions, ref_images, model, output_path, seed, transport)` → edits an existing image with targeted instructions
- `resolve_character_refs(character_name, ref_dir, max_images=5)` → finds reference photos, prioritizing `grid_cleaned/` (Lesson #7)

**Reference Transport** (Lesson #1):
```python
def load_references(image_paths: list[str], transport: str, client) -> list:
    """Load reference images using the specified transport method."""
    if transport == "files_api":
        # Lesson #1: Best quality — preserves micro-biometrics
        return [client.files.upload(file=p) for p in image_paths]
    elif transport == "gcs":
        return [types.Part.from_uri(file_uri=to_gcs_uri(p), mime_type=guess_mime(p)) for p in image_paths]
    else:  # "pil" fallback
        return [PILImage.open(p).convert("RGB") for p in image_paths]
```

**Models & Fallback chain:**
1. Primary: `--image-model` (default: `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`)
2. Fallback: `gemini-3.1-flash-image` → `gemini-2.5-flash-image`

**Prompt hardening** (Lessons #3, #4): ALL prompts get photorealism cues appended:
```python
PHOTOREALISM_SUFFIX = (
    ". Photorealistic photograph, 85mm lens, natural lighting, "
    "authentic skin texture with visible pores, camera-like depth of field, "
    "natural imperfections, NOT a cartoon or illustration."
)
```

---

### Component 3: Dual-Axis Judge (`lib/judge.py`)

#### [NEW] [`lib/judge.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/judge.py)

An LLM-based judge that evaluates TWO separate axes (unlike gemini-tools' single biometric score). Uses structured JSON output via Pydantic schema.

**Key function:** `judge_image(generated_image_path, ref_images, original_prompt, model) → JudgeVerdict`

**Judge prompt** (incorporates Lessons #3, #4, #6):
```
You are an unsparing forensic photographic critic evaluating AI-generated portrait images.
You MUST evaluate TWO separate axes and a photorealism check.

AXIS 1 — RESEMBLANCE (1-10): Compare the person in the generated image against
the reference photos. Scrutinize: bone structure, eye shape/color, nose, lips,
hair color/texture, skin tone, age appearance, distinctive features (moles, dimples).
Score ≥8 means "I would recognize this as the same person in real life."

CRITICAL: If the generated face has unnaturally smooth skin, symmetrical doll-like
features, or shows obvious AI beautification/smoothing, REDUCE the resemblance
score to ≤ 5.0. Real humans have pores, fine lines, and asymmetry.

AXIS 2 — PROMPT ADHERENCE (1-10): Compare the generated image against the original
prompt: "{original_prompt}". Check: scene elements, clothing, actions, setting,
lighting, mood. Score ≥8 means "the image faithfully depicts the described scene."

AXIS 3 — PHOTOREALISM CHECK: Is this a photorealistic image (like a real camera
photo) or does it look like a cartoon, illustration, painting, or 3D render?
A photorealistic image has: natural skin texture, realistic lighting/shadows,
camera-like depth of field, natural imperfections.

Be brutally honest. Use POSITIVE descriptions in your improvement suggestions
(e.g. "add authentic skin texture with visible pores" NOT "do not smooth skin").
```

**Config:**
- `response_mime_type="application/json"`
- `response_schema=JudgeVerdict`
- `temperature=0.2` (deterministic judging)
- Fallback chain: `gemini-3.5-flash` → `gemini-3.6-flash` → `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` (Lesson #12)

### Component 4: Strategy Engine (`lib/strategist.py`)

#### [NEW] [`lib/strategist.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/strategist.py)

The "brain" that decides what to do next based on the judge's feedback.

**Decision logic:**

```python
def decide_strategy(verdict: JudgeVerdict, iteration: int, config: RunConfig) -> tuple[Strategy, str]:
    """Returns (strategy, augmented_prompt).
    Lesson #3: NEVER use negative constraints in augmented prompts.
    Lesson #4: Force regeneration if not photorealistic."""

    # Lesson #4: Non-photorealistic = always regenerate with stronger cues
    if not verdict.is_photorealistic:
        return Strategy.REGENERATE, augment_for_photorealism(config.prompt)

    # If resemblance is the bottleneck → edit (preserve scene, fix face)
    if verdict.adherence_score >= verdict.resemblance_score + 1.5:
        return Strategy.EDIT, build_edit_instructions_for_resemblance(verdict)

    # If adherence is the bottleneck → edit (preserve face, fix scene)
    if verdict.resemblance_score >= verdict.adherence_score + 1.5:
        return Strategy.EDIT, build_edit_instructions_for_adherence(verdict)

    # Both roughly equal and both need improvement → regenerate with full feedback
    if config.dual_strategy:
        return Strategy.DUAL, augment_prompt_with_feedback(config.prompt, verdict)
    else:
        return Strategy.REGENERATE, augment_prompt_with_feedback(config.prompt, verdict)
```

**Prompt augmentation** piggybacks the judge's feedback using ONLY positive instructions (Lesson #3):

```python
def augment_prompt_with_feedback(original_prompt: str, verdict: JudgeVerdict) -> str:
    """Lesson #3: Only positive biometric blueprinting, never negative constraints."""
    return (
        f"{original_prompt}\n\n"
        f"CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS BASED ON PREVIOUS ATTEMPT:\n"
        f"- Resemblance area to improve: {verdict.resemblance_rationale}\n"
        f"- Scene adherence area to improve: {verdict.adherence_rationale}\n"
        f"- Specific improvement needed: {verdict.improvement_suggestion}\n"
        f"- The person MUST match the reference photographs exactly — "
        f"same bone structure, eye color, nose shape, hair texture, skin tone.\n"
        f"- The image MUST be a photorealistic photograph (authentic skin texture "
        f"with visible pores, 85mm lens, natural lighting, camera-like depth of field)."
    )
```

When `--dual-strategy` is active and `Strategy.DUAL` is chosen, the engine generates BOTH an edit AND a regeneration, judges both, and picks the winner for the next iteration.

### Component 5: Score Overlay (`lib/overlay.py`)

#### [NEW] [`lib/overlay.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/overlay.py)

Creates a scored version of each image with an overlay banner. Reuses the exact Pillow+FFmpeg pattern from [`eval_single_model.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/gemini-tools/bin/eval_single_model.py#L82-L129) (Lesson #9).

**Banner content:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ portr8 #3/10                │
│ 👤 resemblance: 6.0/10     │
│ 🎯 adherence:   7.5/10     │
│ 📷 photorealistic: ✅       │
│ verdict: BUONO              │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Function:** `create_scored_image(image_path, verdict, iteration, max_iter, output_path)`

1. Create transparent banner PNG with Pillow (`ImageDraw.Draw`) — semi-transparent black background (alpha 195)
2. Composite with FFmpeg: `ffmpeg -y -i input.png -i banner.png -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]overlay=(W-w)/2:H-h-30"`
3. Fall back to pure Pillow `Image.alpha_composite()` if FFmpeg unavailable

---

### Component 6: Iteration Ledger (`lib/ledger.py`)

#### [NEW] [`lib/ledger.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/ledger.py)

JSONL-based append-only log tracking every iteration (Lesson #10, #13).

```python
class Ledger:
    def __init__(self, run_dir: Path): ...
    def append(self, record: IterationRecord): ...
    def load_all(self) -> list[IterationRecord]: ...
    def best_so_far(self) -> IterationRecord | None:
        """Returns the record with highest min(resemblance, adherence)."""
    def apply_human_override(self, iteration: int, overrides: dict): ...
```

Each run gets its own directory: `out/<run-id>/` where `run-id` is `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-<prompt-slug>`.

**JSONL format** compatible with gemini-tools' `evaluations.jsonl` pattern (Lesson #13):
```json
{
  "iteration": 3,
  "run_id": "2026-08-25-11-30-riccardo-eats-ice-cream",
  "strategy_used": "regenerate",
  "original_prompt": "Riccardo eats an ice cream...",
  "augmented_prompt": "Riccardo eats an ice cream... CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS...",
  "image_path": "~/git/portr8/out/.../image_003.png",
  "seed": 1234567890,
  "resemblance_score": 6.0,
  "adherence_score": 7.5,
  "is_photorealistic": true,
  "verdict": "BUONO",
  "reference_transport": "files_api",
  "robot_eval": { ... },
  "human_eval": null,
  "status": "PENDING_HUMAN",
  "elapsed_seconds": 42.3,
  "timestamp": "2026-08-25T11:30:42Z"
}
```

---

### Component 7: Report Generator (`lib/reporter.py`)

#### [NEW] [`lib/reporter.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/reporter.py)

Generates a Markdown + HTML slide deck from the ledger.

**Report contents:**
1. **Header**: Run configuration, prompt, character, models used
2. **Convergence chart** (ASCII/text): Shows scores over iterations
   ```
   Iteration  Resemblance  Adherence  Photo?  Verdict
   ─────────  ───────────  ─────────  ──────  ─────────
   1          4.0          7.0        ✅      COSÌ-COSÌ
   2          5.5          6.5        ✅      COSÌ-COSÌ
   3          6.0          7.5        ✅      BUONO
   4          5.0 ↓        8.0        ✅      COSÌ-COSÌ   ← score went DOWN
   5          7.5          8.0        ✅      BUONO
   6          8.2          8.5        ✅      CAPOLAVORO 🏆
   ```
3. **Image gallery**: All iterations with their scored overlay images
4. **Strategy log**: Which strategy was used per iteration and why
5. **Best result**: Highlighted with 🏆
6. **Human overrides**: Section showing any calibration corrections
7. **Footer**: Total time, API calls made, final verdict

The HTML version embeds images as base64 for a self-contained portable slide deck.

### Component 9: Rater Calibration (`bin/calibrate.py`)

#### [NEW] [`bin/calibrate.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/bin/calibrate.py)

A separate tool for calibrating the AI judge against human ratings (Lesson #2).

**Workflow:**
1. Takes N pre-generated images (or generates fresh ones)
2. Has M judge models rate each image (default: `gemini-3.5-flash`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-2.5-pro`, `gemini-2.5-flash`)
3. Presents each image to the human for manual scoring via terminal input
4. Produces a **calibration matrix** with Pearson correlation per model
5. Recommends the best judge model (highest correlation with human ratings)
6. Flags known miscalibration patterns (Lesson #2: kate_lion.png = 7.0 AI vs 1.0 human)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Generate 5 test images and calibrate 5 judge models
./bin/calibrate.py -c riccardo -p "Riccardo at a cafe in Rome" --num-images 5

# Calibrate on existing images from a previous run
./bin/calibrate.py --images-dir out/2026-08-25-11-30-riccardo/ -c riccardo
```

**Output (calibration matrix):**

```
┌────────────┬───────────┬──────────────────┬──────────────────┬──────────┐
│ Image      │ Human     │ gemini-3.5-flash │ gemini-3.1-pro   │ Δ (best) │

### Component 10: Human Override Mechanism

#### Integrated into [`bin/portr8.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/bin/portr8.py) and [`lib/ledger.py`](file:///usr/local/google/home/ricc/git/portr8/lib/ledger.py)

After a run completes (or during, if interrupted), Riccardo can override any AI score:

```bash
# Override scores for iteration 3
./bin/portr8.py override --run-id 2026-08-25-11-30-riccardo-eats-ice-cream \
  --iteration 3 --resemblance 5.0 --adherence 8.0 --note "Face is too smooth, AI beautification"

# Re-generate report with human corrections
./bin/report.py --run-id 2026-08-25-11-30-riccardo-eats-ice-cream
```

This patches the ledger JSONL with a `human_override` field (compatible with gemini-tools' `human_eval` pattern, Lesson #13).

---

## Implementation Order (Task Breakdown)

### Phase 1: Foundation (Tasks 1-3)
1. **Project Scaffolding**: Create directory structure, git init, pyproject.toml, Justfile, .env.dist, .gitignore, README.md, VERSION, CHANGELOG.md, GEMINI.md. Symlink `data/characters/`.
2. **Data Models** (`lib/models.py`): All Pydantic models. Tests for serialization.
3. **Ledger** (`lib/ledger.py`): JSONL append/read/query/override. Tests.

### Phase 2: Core Pipeline (Tasks 4-6)
4. **Image Generator** (`lib/generator.py`): `generate_from_prompt()`, `edit_image()`, `resolve_character_refs()`, reference transport. Tests with mocked API.
5. **Dual-Axis Judge** (`lib/judge.py`): `judge_image()` with anti-beautification prompt. Tests.
6. **Strategy Engine** (`lib/strategist.py`): `decide_strategy()`, prompt augmentation (positive only!). Tests.

### Phase 3: Polish (Tasks 7-9)
7. **Score Overlay** (`lib/overlay.py`): Banner creation + FFmpeg composite. Tests.
8. **Main CLI Loop** (`bin/portr8.py`): Wire everything together. Rich console output. End-to-end smoke test.
9. **Report Generator** (`lib/reporter.py` + `bin/report.py`): Markdown + HTML. Tests.

### Phase 4: Advanced (Tasks 10-11)
10. **Rater Calibration** (`bin/calibrate.py`): Multi-model comparison, human input, correlation matrix.
11. **Human Override** (`bin/portr8.py override`): Score patching, report regeneration.

---

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
```bash
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Manual Verification
1. **Smoke test**: `just demo` (3 iterations) — verify images generated, scored, logged, report produced
2. **Convergence test**: Full 10 iterations — verify early stop when 8/8 reached
3. **Dual strategy test**: `--dual-strategy` — verify both paths tried
4. **Calibration test**: `just calibrate` — verify matrix output
5. **Override test**: Override a score and regenerate report
6. **Report test**: Open HTML slide deck in browser — verify self-contained

### Expected Runtime
- Each iteration: ~30-60s (generation ~15-30s + judging ~5-10s + overlay ~2s)
- 10 iterations: ~5-10 minutes (the "10min undisturbed" target 🎯)
- Dual strategy: ~2x generation time per iteration
- Calibration (5 images × 5 models): ~10-15 minutes
